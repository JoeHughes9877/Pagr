# Pagr

Pagr is a minimalist terminal-based eBook reader designed to provide a smooth, Kindle-like reading experience directly in your command line. It supports plain text formats, keyboard navigation and more.

# Motive

I like reading ebooks, but sometimes the formatting on Kindle can get weird when they are "borrowed" off the internet. So I made this to make it so I could read ebooks on my PC and laptop easier.
