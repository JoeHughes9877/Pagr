THE BOOK WITHOUT A NAME
by [Anonymous]

Chapter 1: The Bookshop in the Rain

The rain began just after dusk, tapping against the narrow windows like a polite but persistent visitor. By the time Leah reached the corner bookstore, her coat was soaked through and her hair clung in wet spirals to her cheeks. She stepped inside, shivering, and let the door’s bell announce her arrival to the empty shop.

The air smelled of old paper and brewed tea. Shelves leaned with the weight of too many stories, and the overhead lights cast a gentle amber glow. She was alone, except for the man behind the counter who glanced up briefly from a battered ledger.

"You’re late," he said.

Leah hesitated. "I don't think we’ve met."

The man closed the ledger. His eyes were pale, almost silver, and they didn’t blink as often as they should have. "I said you’re late, not that I knew you. The book’s been waiting."

She laughed nervously. "I’m just here to browse."

"You can browse," he said, "but it won’t matter. It always ends with the book."

Something about his tone was both ridiculous and unsettling. Leah moved toward the shelves, more to escape his gaze than to find anything in particular. The spines whispered as her fingers passed over them.

She stopped when one book, unlike the rest, pulsed faintly under her touch.

Chapter 2: The Book Without a Name

It was bound in soft, black leather. No title. The pages looked brittle but warm, as if they had been waiting in a sunbeam for years. When she opened it, the text inside shifted like ink swimming through water, reshaping itself until it formed words she knew.

Her own name was the first thing she read.

The second line was today’s date.

The third line began to describe what she was doing in that very moment, right down to the way her thumb traced the book’s edge and the sound of the rain outside. A thin coil of fear wound through her. She turned the page and saw more—things that hadn’t happened yet.

The bell over the door rang again. A woman stepped inside, her face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Leah’s breath caught; the book had mentioned her arrival only seconds earlier.

The woman walked up to Leah without a glance at the shelves. "You shouldn’t have opened it," she said.

Leah shut the book quickly. "Do you know what this is?"

"I know it doesn’t belong to you." The woman’s voice was low, almost drowned by the rain’s growing roar. "Once you start reading, the story begins to take you with it. The longer you hold it, the less you’ll remember what’s yours."

Chapter 3: The Last Page

Leah’s heart thumped in her chest. "Then why give it to me?"

"I didn’t." The woman looked over Leah’s shoulder toward the counter. "He did."

Leah turned, but the man was gone. The counter was empty, the ledger closed and dust already forming on its cover. A shiver raced down her spine.

"I don’t want this," Leah said, holding the book out to the woman.

She shook her head. "It’s not a matter of want. It’s written now."

The lights flickered. The rain outside grew louder, though Leah couldn’t see the street anymore—just an endless curtain of water, as if the world had shrunk to the shop alone. She opened the book again without meaning to, her fingers moving as if guided by someone else. The words now described the feel of her own pulse, fast and erratic.

The next line told her she would follow the woman out the door.

Leah’s throat was dry. "Where does it end?"

The woman’s eyes were shadowed beneath the brim. "The last page."

"And then?"

"You won’t be reading by then."

The bell chimed once more, though neither of them had moved. The door stood open, showing only darkness beyond. The woman stepped toward it. Leah tried to drop the book, but it clung to her hand like a second skin.

The final thing she saw before crossing the threshold was the shelves collapsing in silent slow motion, the air filling with drifting, unbound pages.

And then the story kept going.
